# Scalability vs Performance

## Introduction

**Scalability** and **performance** are often used together but mean different things. Both matter for building systems that handle growth and load.

## Definitions

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Scalability** | Ability to handle growth by adding resources (scale out/in) |
| **Performance** | Speed/efficiency of a system at a given scale |

**Scalability** asks: *Can we grow?*  
**Performance** asks: *How fast does it run now?*

A system can be performant but not scalable (hits a ceiling). A scalable system can grow; a performant system runs well at current scale.

## Q&A

### Basic

**Q: Explain scalability vs performance.**

**A:** Scalability is the ability to handle more load by adding resources (more servers, more capacity). Performance is how fast or efficiently the system runs at a given scale. A system can be performant (fast single request) but not scalable (hits a ceiling). A scalable system can grow; a performant system runs well at current scale.
