# System Design Interview Notes

This repository contains my personal notes for system design interview preparation.

## Coverage
- Core foundations
- API & data design
- Caching & scalability
- Resilience & security
- Real-world system design problems

## How to Use
- Start with foundations
- Revise patterns daily
- Practice design cases weekly

## Interview Base

**[INTERVIEW-BASE.md](./INTERVIEW-BASE.md)** — Interview preparation index and navigation hub for Senior Solution Architect:
- Links to all topic pages with introductions and Q&A (Basic, Medium, Complex)
- Content lives in respective topic files (e.g., `00-foundations/availability-vs-reliability.md`)
- Browse by section or navigate directly to any topic

## Goal
Build clarity, confidence, and structured thinking for system design interviews.


Structured notes and reference material for system design interviews.
